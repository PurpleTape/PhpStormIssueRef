# Project #1

This project will be used in other projects so that they can use the "MyComponent1" component.

I tried to simplify the approach described in the initial post, so the @components alias is used for the components directory

In the App.vue file, you can see that PhpStorm understands the alias without any problems. To start the development server, write:
```
npm run serve
```
